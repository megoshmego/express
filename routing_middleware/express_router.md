This transcript is about structuring Express.js applications and specifically discusses the following main concepts:

1. **Express Router**: Express Router allows developers to organize their routes better by splitting them across different files, which is especially useful for larger applications or those with RESTful APIs. This way, each resource can have its own router file (e.g., usersRoutes.js, todosRoutes.js). 

2. **Middleware**: Middleware functions are invoked by the Express.js routing layer before the final request handler. They are briefly mentioned in this video, but no specific details are provided.

3. **Testing Express apps**: This is brought up but not elaborated upon within this transcript.

4. **Route Prefixes**: By using the Express Router, developers can simplify their routes and make it easier to manage and update them. When defining the routes in their own file, they don't need to include the full path (e.g., '/users'). Instead, they can use a simplified path (e.g., '/') and then prefix everything with '/users' when adding the routes to the app.js file. This makes it easier to change the route prefixes in the future, as it only needs to be changed in one place.

To demonstrate these concepts, the instructor starts by creating a new file called 'userRoutes.js'. In this file, they:

1. Import Express: `const express = require('express');`

2. Create a new Express router: `const router = new express.Router();`

3. Define a route on the router object: `router.get('/', (req, res) => { /* callback function */ });`

4. Export the router: `module.exports = router;`

Then, in the 'app.js' file, they:

1. Import the user routes: `const userRoutes = require('./userRoutes');`

2. Use the user routes with a prefix of '/users': `app.use('/users', userRoutes);`

This approach allows the '/users' prefix to be added to all routes defined in the 'userRoutes.js' file. Therefore, a GET request to '/users' would trigger the callback function defined for the route in 'userRoutes.js'.
