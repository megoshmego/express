Sure, let's identify the main terms and ideas from the transcript:

1. **res.send():** This is a method in Express.js that is used to send a response to a client. It's important to note that this method does not stop the execution of the function. The function will continue executing the next lines of code even after res.send().

2. **return:** In JavaScript, the return statement stops the execution of a function and sends a value back to the caller. In the context of Express.js, if return is used before res.send(), the execution of the function stops after the response is sent. This is useful to prevent further code execution in situations where you don't want anything to execute after the response is sent.

3. **Error handling:** The process of responding to and managing errors during the execution of your code. In the context of the video, this is done by checking if a greeting exists for the given language, and if it doesn't, sending an "invalid language" response to the client.

4. **toUpperCase():** This is a JavaScript method that converts a string to uppercase letters. In the video, this method is used to convert the greeting to uppercase before sending it as a response. 

Here's a simple demonstration of the concepts in JavaScript and Express.js:

```javascript
app.get('/:lang', (req, res) => {
  const greetings = {
    en: 'Hello',
    fr: 'Bonjour',
    ic: 'HÃ¦',
    ja: 'Konichiwa'
  };
  
  const greeting = greetings[req.params.lang];
  
  if (!greeting) {
    return res.send('Invalid language');
  }
  
  res.send(greeting.toUpperCase());
});
```

In this code, we're defining a route that takes a language code as a parameter. We have a greetings object that maps language codes to greetings. We get the greeting for the language code from the request parameters. If the greeting doesn't exist, we return an "Invalid language" response to the client. If the greeting exists, we convert it to uppercase and send it as a response. The return statement before res.send('Invalid language') ensures that if an invalid language code is provided, the function execution stops there and doesn't try to convert undefined to uppercase, which would throw an error.
