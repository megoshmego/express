The speaker in the transcript is explaining how to use supertest, a tool used for integration testing of Express apps. Here are the important terms and ideas in this transcript:

1. **Express apps**: Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js, used for building web applications and APIs. 

2. **Integration tests**: Integration tests are designed to test how different parts of an application work together. They differ from unit tests, which only test a single function or component at a time.

3. **Endpoints**: In the context of web development, an endpoint refers to a URL where a service can be accessed by a client application. Here, the speaker is referring to the routes of the Express application.

4. **Supertest**: Supertest is a library used for testing HTTP servers. It's often used in conjunction with a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.

5. **HTTP methods**: These are the standard methods in HTTP protocol that a server can interpret. The most common ones are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.

6. **Status codes**: HTTP status codes are the response codes that a server returns to indicate the result of a client's request. Common ones include 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), etc.

7. **Development dependencies**: These are dependencies that are only needed for development purposes, such as testing libraries or transpilers. These dependencies are not necessary for running the application in production.

8. **Express.JSON middleware**: This is a built-in middleware function in Express that parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.

9. **Express Router**: This is a class in Express used to create route handlers.

10. **Insomnia**: Insomnia is a powerful HTTP and REST client used for testing APIs.

A simple demonstration of these concepts could be:
```javascript
// Importing necessary libraries
const express = require('express');
const supertest = require('supertest');

// Creating an instance of an Express app
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// Defining a simple route
app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello, World!' });
});

// Starting the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});

// Writing a test for the route using supertest
describe('GET /hello', () => {
  it('responds with a greeting', async () => {
    const response = await supertest(app).get('/hello');
    expect(response.statusCode).toEqual(200);
    expect(response.body.message).toEqual('Hello, World!');
  });
});
```
This code sets up a simple Express application with a single route (`/hello`), starts the server, and uses supertest to write a test for the `/hello` route. The test checks that the HTTP status code of the response is 200 and that the response body contains the expected greeting message.
