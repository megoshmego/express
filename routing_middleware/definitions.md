Condensed Terms and Definitions:

1. **Express Router:** A feature in Express.js that organizes routes across different files, aiding in managing routes for larger applications or RESTful APIs. It allows defining simplified paths that are prefixed when added to the main application file.

2. **Middleware:** Functions in Express.js that intercept the routing process, performing operations on the request and response objects, and controlling the flow of execution through the `next()` function.

3. **Testing Express apps:** This refers to the practice of validating Express routes, data handling, and response delivery, often using tools like Jest or Mocha alongside libraries like Supertest.

4. **Route Prefixes:** A feature in Express Router allowing simplified route definitions in isolated files. The full path is prefixed when routes are added to the main application file, simplifying management and modification.

5. **Request and Response Cycle:** The flow of data and control between a client and a server, where middleware functions operate.

6. **app.use:** An Express.js method used to mount middleware functions, which are then executed upon receiving a request.

7. **Express.json:** A built-in middleware in Express.js that parses incoming JSON payloads.

8. **Logger Function:** A custom middleware function that logs details about incoming requests.

9. **Favicon.ico:** A small icon requested by browsers from websites, displayed on the browser tab.

10. **Error Handlers:** Middleware functions in Express.js specifically designed to handle errors.

11. **Morgan:** A middleware for logging HTTP requests in Node.js applications.

12. **NPM (Node Package Manager):** A tool for installing, sharing, and managing Node.js packages.

13. **'dev':** A predefined format string in Morgan for development use, providing concise, color-coded output.

14. **Integration Testing:** A type of testing that checks how different components of an application work together, as opposed to unit testing which checks individual components.

15. **supertest:** A library for testing HTTP server requests, often used with a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.

16. **Development Dependency:** Dependencies that are only required during the development process but aren't necessary for running the application in production.

17. **Endpoints:** URLs where a service can be accessed by a client application.

18. **HTTP methods:** Standard methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) in HTTP protocol interpreted by a server.

19. **Status codes:** Response codes returned by a server to indicate the result of a client's request (e.g., 200, 404, 500).

20. **Insomnia:** An HTTP and REST client used for testing APIs.

21. **Separation of Server and Application:** The practice of structuring server logic separately for easier route testing.

22. **Use of beforeEach and afterEach:** Jest functions used to set up and reset the test environment before and after each test.

23. **res.send():** An Express.js method used to send a response to a client.

24. **return:** A JavaScript statement that stops the execution of a function and returns a value.

25. **Error handling:** The process of managing errors during code execution.

26. **toUpperCase():** A JavaScript method that converts a string to uppercase letters.
