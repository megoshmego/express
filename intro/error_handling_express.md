Important Terms and Concepts:

1. **Error Handling**: This is a crucial concept in all software development, particularly in web development. Errors can occur on both the user side (incorrect data, missing data, missing credentials) and the server side (syntax errors, database errors).

2. **Express**: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. In the context of this transcript, Express is being used to handle errors.

3. **Status Codes**: HTTP status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server. In the context of this transcript, different status codes (404, 403, 500) are used to communicate different types of errors to the client.

4. **SQLAlchemy**: SQLAlchemy is a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for the Python programming language. It provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access.

5. **Postgres**: PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance. 

6. **Route Handler**: In Express, a route handler function has the signature `(req, res, next)`, where `req` is the request object, `res` is the response object, and `next` is a function that is invoked to execute the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

7. **Middleware**: Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the `next` function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

Concept Demonstration:

To demonstrate some of these concepts, let's create a simple Express server with error handling:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Custom Error class
class ExpressError extends Error {
  constructor(message, status) {
    super();
    this.message = message;
    this.status = status;
  }
}

// Routes
app.get('/secret', (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.query.password !== 'popcorn') {
    throw new ExpressError('Invalid password', 403);
  }
  res.send('Congrats, you know the password!');
});

app.get('*', (req, res, next) => {
  throw new ExpressError('Page not found', 404);
});

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  const { status = 500, message = 'Something went wrong' } = err;
  res.status(status).send(message);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

This simple Express server has a route `/secret` which checks for the correct password. If the password is incorrect, it throws a custom error with the message 'Invalid password' and a 403 status code. If the user tries to access any other route, it throws a custom error with the message 'Page not found' and a 404 status code.

The error handling middleware function, defined with `app.use`, handles these custom errors. It destructures the status and message from the error object and sends a response to the client with the status code and message. If no status code or message is provided, it defaults to 500 and 'Something went wrong', respectively.
