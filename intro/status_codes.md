Sure, here are the key concepts, terms, and a summary of the main points from the transcript you've provided:

1. **Status Codes**: These are part of HTTP responses and indicate the status of the request. Common ones include 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 400 (Bad Request), 403 (Forbidden), and 404 (Not Found).

2. **Express.js**: This is a web application framework for Node.js, which is used to build web applications and APIs. It has various in-built methods that help with HTTP requests and responses, such as `.status()`.

3. **`res.status()`:** This is a method in Express.js that is used to set the status code for a response. It should be used before `.json()` or `.send()`, otherwise, the response will be sent without the status code. 

4. **`res.json()`, `res.send()`:** These are methods in Express.js used to send a response back to the client. `res.json()` sends a JSON response, while `res.send()` can send various types of responses.

5. **RESTful conventions**: This is a set of guidelines for structuring HTTP requests. In this context, the speaker is referring to the convention of returning a 201 status code when a resource is successfully created.

6. **Insomnia**: This is a software used for testing APIs. It allows users to send HTTP requests and view the responses.

Here is a simple demonstration of these concepts:

Let's say we're building an API for a bookstore. When a new book is added, we want to return a 201 status code. We can achieve this with Express.js as follows:

```javascript
app.post('/books', (req, res) => {
  // Code to add the book...
  
  res.status(201).json({ message: 'Book successfully created.' });
});
```

In this code, `app.post()` is used to handle a POST request at the '/books' route. After the code to add the book runs, we set the status code to 201 using `res.status(201)` and send a JSON response with `res.json()`.

If we wanted to forbid adding a book with a certain title, we could do:

```javascript
app.post('/books', (req, res) => {
  if (req.body.title === 'Forbidden Book') {
    return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Forbidden Book is not allowed.' });
  }

  // Code to add the book...
  
  res.status(201).json({ message: 'Book successfully created.' });
});
```

Now, if a book with the title 'Forbidden Book' is attempted to be added, the server will return a 403 status code with a message indicating that it's not allowed.
