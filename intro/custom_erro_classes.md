This transcript is from a tutorial about error handling in Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js. Here are the key concepts and terms explained:

1. **Route handler in Express.js**: This is a function in Express.js that takes in a request from the client, processes it, and sends back a response. It is usually associated with a particular URL pattern and HTTP verb.

2. **HTTP status codes**: These are standard codes that servers send back to clients to indicate the status of a request. For example, 500 signifies an internal server error, 404 indicates not found, and 401 represents unauthorized.

3. **Error handling in Express.js**: Express.js has built-in error handling that sends a 500 status code by default if an error is thrown in a route handler.

4. **Extending JavaScript error class**: This involves creating a new class that inherits from the JavaScript built-in Error class. This new class can have additional properties and methods tailored to specific needs. In the tutorial, an ExpressError class is created to customize error handling in Express.js.

5. **Creating an ExpressError class**: This class extends the JavaScript Error class and adds a status code and message. The status code is meant to be sent back as the HTTP status code, and the message is meant to be sent back as the response text.

6. **Throwing errors**: Throwing an error in JavaScript interrupts the normal execution flow of the program. In Express.js, throwing an error in a route handler triggers the built-in error handling, or custom error handling if it's defined.

7. **Stack trace**: This is a report of the active stack frames at a certain point in time during the execution of a program. When an error is thrown, a stack trace is often included to help locate the source of the error.

8. **Middleware in Express.js**: These are functions that have access to the request object, the response object, and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. In the context of this tutorial, middleware can be used to define custom error handling.

9. **Importing and exporting modules in Node.js**: The `require` function is used to import a module in Node.js, and `module.exports` is used to export something from a module. In the tutorial, the ExpressError class is exported from a module and then imported into the main app.js file.

Here's a simple demonstration of these concepts:

```javascript
// expressError.js
class ExpressError extends Error {
    constructor(message, status) {
        super();
        this.message = message;
        this.status = status;
    }
}
module.exports = ExpressError;

// app.js
const express = require('express');
const ExpressError = require('./expressError');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    throw new ExpressError('Page not found', 404);
});

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    // custom error handling
    res.status(err.status || 500);
    res.send(err.message || 'Internal Server Error');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('App is running on port 3000');
});
```
In this demonstration, a GET request to the root route ("/") will throw a new ExpressError with the message "Page not found" and the status 404. The middleware function at the end handles the error by sending back the error's status and message as the HTTP response.
