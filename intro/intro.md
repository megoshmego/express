This transcript focuses on the concepts of Node.js, web development, and the Express.js framework. Here are the key terms and ideas:

1. **Node.js**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, allowing developers to use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. 

2. **Web Development**: This refers to the creation of websites or web applications. It involves aspects such as front-end (client-side) development, back-end (server-side) development, and database management.

3. **Server**: In the context of web development, a server is a system that processes requests and delivers data to a client (typically a web browser) over the internet.

4. **Routes**: In web development, routes determine how an application responds to a client request for a specific endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (like GET, POST, and so on).

5. **HTTP requests and responses**: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for transferring data over the web. It works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

6. **Express.js**: Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs. It's unopinionated, meaning that it doesn't guide you towards any specific method of managing your web application.

7. **Flask**: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It's designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It's a microframework that doesnâ€™t include an ORM (Object Relational Manager) or such features.

8. **Django**: Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It's a more heavy-duty option than Flask.

9. **Popularity of Express.js**: The instructor explains that Express.js is the most popular framework in Node.js, referring to a 2018 survey.

10. **Future topics**: The instructor mentions they will explore setting up a server, defining routes, working with query strings, form data, adding a database, templating, and implementing authentication in future videos.

To demonstrate the basic idea of creating a server with Node.js and Express.js, here is a simple code snippet:

```javascript
// Importing express module
const express = require('express');

// Creating an express app
const app = express();

// Defining a route at the root URL
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!');
});

// Starting the server on port 3000
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

In this code:
- We start by importing the `express` module.
- We then create an instance of an express application.
- We define a simple route for the root URL ("/") that sends the text "Hello, world!" back to the client.
- Finally, we start our server on port 3000, and log a message to the console once the server is running.
