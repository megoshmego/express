Condensed terms and definitions:

1. **Express.js:** A Node.js framework used to build web applications and APIs, incorporating middleware, routing, and error handling.

2. **Middleware:** Functions in Express.js that manipulate request and response objects, or pass control to the next middleware using the `next()` function.

3. **Route Handlers:** Functions in Express.js that process HTTP requests and responses based on specific URL patterns and HTTP methods.

4. **app.use():** An Express.js method used to mount middleware functions at specific paths.

5. **Express Router:** A feature of Express.js for organizing routes across different files, aiding in managing larger applications or RESTful APIs.

6. **NPM:** The default package manager for Node.js, used to manage project dependencies.

7. **Package.json:** A Node.js file containing metadata about the project and its dependencies.

8. **HTTP status codes:** Response codes from servers indicating the status of a client's request, such as 404 for "Not Found" and 500 for "Internal Server Error."

9. **Server:** A system that processes requests and delivers data to a client over the internet.

10. **HTTP requests and responses:** The protocol for data transfer over the web, operating as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

11. **Express.json & Express.urlencoded:** Middleware functions in Express.js used to parse incoming request bodies with a JSON or URL-encoded payload, respectively.

12. **Custom Error Class:** An extension of the JavaScript Error class used to customize error handling in Express.js.

13. **Error Handlers:** Special middleware functions in Express.js for handling errors.

14. **Node.js module import and export:** Techniques for sharing code between different parts of a Node.js application using `require` and `module.exports`.

15. **Chrome DevTools, debugger keyword, --inspect and --inspect-brk flags, and chrome://inspect:** Tools and techniques used for debugging Node.js code.

16. **nodemon:** A development tool for Node.js that automatically restarts the application when file changes are detected.

17. **Testing Express apps:** The practice of validating Express.js routes, data handling, and response delivery, often using tools like Jest or Mocha and libraries like Supertest.

18. **Morgan:** A middleware for logging HTTP requests in Node.js applications.

19. **Insomnia:** An HTTP and REST client used for testing APIs.

20. **Port:** A communication endpoint where a service or process listens for requests.

21. **Routes:** Express.js configurations defining how an application responds to a client request for a specific endpoint and HTTP method.

22. **Integration Testing:** A type of testing that checks how different components of an application work together.

23. **Development Dependency:** Dependencies needed only during development and not necessary for running the application in production. 

24. **Separation of Server and Application:** A design principle for structuring server logic separately from the rest of the application for easier testing.

25. **Postgres:** An open-source relational database management system known for SQL compliance.

26. **SQLAlchemy:** A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for Python, providing efficient database access.
